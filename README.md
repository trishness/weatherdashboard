# weatherdashboard

This assignment incorporated the skills and tools we have acquired in jQuery and APIs, concurrently utilizing our knowledge of JavaScript. Upon opening the page, you will automatically be presented with a collection of weather information pertaining to the city the user most recently searched or with Seattle's weather information if it is the first time the user has visited the site. To view the city searched by the user, the OpenWeather API was utilized in the script. The first API is accessed with an ajax function containing a query URL that incorporates the content of the search form with a variable, thus displaying 7 days worth of detailed information pertaining to that city. From that information, the latitude and longitude is stored into a variable (as well as the specific information we want to display on the site) to then be used in a second ajax function within our parent function. This secondary function gathers the UV index information that was not present on the first API. From these two APIs, the current city, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index. Conditionals were added to display the risk level of the UV index - green being low, yellow being moderate and red being high. To display the 5 day forecast of the city being displayed, a loop was created within the overarching function to gather the upcoming 5 days' weather forecasts. All time displayed on the site was gathered and displayed using moment.js.

Once a user has searched for a city, it is automatically stored into local storage and then displayed beneath the search bar. The user is able to navigate back to previously searched items by clicking on them within this list. Once the user has searched for 5 cities, the user's oldest search will be deleted and the new city will be added to the list. If the user searches for the same city twice, the city will not be added to the list to prevent duplicates in their search history.
